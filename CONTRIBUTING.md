1. Any fix PR should initially contain two commits: one with unit tests that fail, one with a fix.
1. Discussion in a PR may yield further fixes ontop. We'll squeeze them when merging.
1. Any feature PR should first be discussed in an Issue.
1. Any one commit should address one specific problem, do not clutter a commit with unrelated fixes or features.
1. Complete file changes are not going to be reviewed at all in 99% of cases.
1. In merge conflict cases we'll ask you to rebase off of a specific branch and force push once more.
1. We value your time as much as we value ours.
